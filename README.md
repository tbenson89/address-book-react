# Project Purpose & Objectives

    The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to create a simple Address book using React application using Typescript HTML and CSS.


## Requirements 

The project is to develop a SPA - Address/Contact Book, using GIT nad Github as Version Control. Typescript for JS that scales. 

I've have been using TFS/Azure environments a lot so it took me a couple commits to *git* back in the groove. There is no backend. but if we have time we will add a cache and empty cache feature to save some of the data. 


 ### Feature Requirements: 

- Ability to Add, Edit, and delete contacts
- Contacts should have a these properties
    - Name
    - Address
    - Email
    - Phone
    - Notes
- Ability to view all contacts in a list sorted alphebetically by name or email
- Ability to search for a contact by name, email or phone number

## Production Notes


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Deployment

If we have time we will deploy the application setting up our cPanel to work with Node projects or put it in an AWS instance. I also haven't tried vercel. So i do plan on trying that free tier out. There's also storj!
