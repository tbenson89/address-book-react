# Project Purpose & Objectives

    The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to create a simple Address book using React application using Typescript HTML and CSS.


## Requirements 

The project is to develop a SPA - Address/Contact Book, using GIT nad Github as Version Control. Typescript for JS that scales. 

I've have been using TFS/Azure environments a lot so it took me a couple commits to *git* back in the groove. There is no backend. but if we have time we will add a cache and empty cache feature to save some of the data. 


 ### Feature Requirements: 

- Ability to Add, Edit, and delete contacts
- Contacts should have a these properties
    - Name
    - Address
    - Email
    - Phone
    - Notes
- Ability to view all contacts in a list sorted alphebetically by name or email
- Ability to search for a contact by name, email or phone number
